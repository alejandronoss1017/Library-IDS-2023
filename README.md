# üóûÔ∏è Overall

This project aims to put into practice various communication concepts and patterns found in today's distributed systems.

This project is divided into 2 parts, one being the server and the other the client, the client component must make requests to the server through network protocols (**TCP**) and the server responds to the requests.

# üì∂ Tech stack

Since this project is divided into two completely different components, the dependencies will vary, but the technologies used for the development of both are the same.

- [Java 17 LTS](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html)

- [Maven](https://maven.apache.org/)

- [Jeromq](https://zeromq.org/)

- [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)

# üîÑ Replication configuration

For the development of this service a bidirectional replication scheme was implemented, based on the model (**MASTER-SLAVE**), where both databases are slaves and masters at the same time, which allows that any change made in any of the two instances will be reflected in the other, MYSQL offers this replication option, it is only necessary to configure the instances.

## Master-Slave configuration

1. Open the MySQL configuration file on the source server. The path to this file varies depending on the operating system:

**Windows**: C:\ProgramData\MySQL\MySQL Server x.x\my.ini
**Linux**: /etc/mysql/mysql.conf.d/mysqld.cnf

2. Locate the [mysqld] section inside the configuration file.

3. Add the following lines to enable binary logging and set a unique server ID:

```bash
log-bin=mysql-bin
server-id=1
```

4. Save the configuration file and restart the MySQL service.

5. Log in to the Master DB and create a user with replication privileges:

```bash
CREATE USER 'replication_user'@'%' IDENTIFIED BY 'password';
GRANT REPLICATION SLAVE ON *.* TO 'replication_user'@'%';
FLUSH PRIVILEGES;
```

6. Run the following SQL command to retrieve the binary log coordinates:

```bash
SHOW MASTER STATUS;
```

> Note down the values of the File and Position columns, as we'll need them in the next step.

## Slave-Master configuration

7. On the Slave DB, open the configuration file and add the following lines in the [mysqld] section:

```bash
log-bin=mysql-bin
server-id=2
```

8. Save the configuration file and restart the MySQL service.

9. Access the slave DB and run the following command to configure replication:

```bash
CHANGE MASTER TO
MASTER_HOST='serverA_IP',
MASTER_USER='replication_user',
MASTER_PASSWORD='password',
MASTER_LOG_FILE='mysql-bin.XXXXXX',
MASTER_LOG_POS=XXXXXX;
SOURCE_SSL=1;
```

> Put the values from the step 4

10. Starts replication on slave DB:

```bash
START SLAVE;
```

11. Repeat steps 2 and 3, reversing the roles of the Master and Slave DB's. Now Slave will become the master and Master will be the Slave.

With the above steps a bidirectional replication will be obtained.
